<h1>Pairwise Dialogue Evaluations for Chatbots</h1>

<p>
(You can only work on one of these HITs per batch, and attempting additional HITs will result in an error!) 
</p>

<p>
In this task you will have a conversation and play the part of a given character. For example, your given character could be: "I am an accountant. I like to go on bike rides." Throughout the conversation, feel free to chat with your conversation partner however you’d like and however feels natural.
</p>

<p>
Each time it's your partner's turn to speak, they’ll give two possible responses. It’ll be up to you to decide which response to pick, based on some given criteria. Don't base your choice on their hobbies, job, etc. Finally, you’ll be asked to explain briefly why you’ve made that choice. You may also have the option to send your own response if you think that neither response is acceptable. Failure to include an explanation could result in your hits being rejected.

Notes:

<ul>
    <li><b>Do not provide any personal information!</b></li>
    <li>Do not trivially copy the character descriptions into the message.</li>
    <li>The conversation will continue for at least 6 turns for each person, and then you or your partner can end the conversation when you wish.</li>
    <li>The task will eventually time out if there has been no activity.</li>
    <li>Please do not send long or short messages: messages should contain between 3-30 words.</li>
    <li>Please do not reference the task or MTurk itself during the conversation.</li>
    <li>Note that your conversation partner may be either a human or a bot.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind that the conversations will eventually be made public, so act as you would on a public social network (e.g. Twitter).</li>
    <li>No racism, sexism or otherwise offensive comments, or the submission will be rejected and we will report to Amazon.</li>
</ul>
